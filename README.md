# The Privacy Rights Platform â€” Browser Extension

The Privacy Rights Platform Browser Extension sends Do Not Sell signals to websites that users wish to access. 

We accomplish this by:
1) Providing users with options regarding who to send the Do Not Sell signals to. 
2) Providing users information about locations we have sent the Do Not Sell signal to. 
3) By sending an HTTP request header upon website access noting to website hosts that the user does not want their data sold, according to the options above.

This extension is designed to be compliant with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). 

## Running and Installing the Privacy Rights Platform

You can currently install the Privacy Rights Platform to any Chrome-based web browser. While we do not currently support Firefox, we are diligently working on compatabilty across both Chrome-based browsers and Firefox. 

Note that though this extension has been thoroughly tested in Google Chrome, it should also run in other Chrome-based browsers including Vivaldi, Opera, Microsoft Edge, and Brave, amongst others.
