      OptMeowt ("Opt Me Out") üêæ is a browser extension for sending 
      Do Not Sell signals to websites users choose to visit. 
    </br></br>
      OptMeowt aims to be a technical implmenetation of a Do Not Sell standardization
      effort we are spearheading in cooperation with large industry 
      publishers. In the meantime, we also function as an opt out solution 
      that aggregates several of the ways companies accept opt outs 
      today with regards to the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).
